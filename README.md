PySL - Python library for accessing SL:s real-time data
via http://www.trafiklab.se/api.

Initially written in PHP by Robin Linderborg 
(https://github.com/Albuzz/trafiklab),
and then pythonified by Anders Ekbom (@dsrg).

Still very much a work in progress, so expect and plan for changes in methods, 
parameters etc.

Comments are welcome!
